My name is Korban O'Brien, you can call me Korban O'Brien

My major is Electrical and Computer Engineering and I am a sophomore.
Yes I have signed up for Piazza
The most interesting fact about me is that I can't listen to music with words while doing homework, so I listen to movie soundtracks,
and as the only time that I listen to music is while doing homework, I really only listen to movie score music.
